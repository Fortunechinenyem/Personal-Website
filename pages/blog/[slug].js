          Transitioning to tech was one of the most challenging yet rewarding
          decisions I‚Äôve ever made. It all started when I realized my passion
          for problem-solving and creating solutions that impact people‚Äôs lives.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          My journey into tech began with a deep curiosity about how websites
          and apps work. I started by learning HTML and CSS, then moved on to
          JavaScript and React. Over time, I built projects, contributed to open
          source, and eventually landed my first job.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I began by learning the basics of programming through online courses
          and coding bootcamps. It wasn‚Äôt easy juggling my full-time job and
          studies, but my determination kept me going. Fast forward to today,
          I‚Äôm now a full-stack developer working on exciting projects that push
          the boundaries of technology.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you‚Äôre considering a career in tech, my advice is to start small,
          stay consistent, and never stop learning. The journey might be tough,
          but the rewards are worth it.

          One of the key things that helped me was creating a daily schedule

          also important to communicate with your employer about your needs and
          seek support from your partner or family members.

          Having worked with MongoDB and Firebase, I'm tempted to make certain

          Recently, as a learning project, I decided to build a task management

          Ah, Valentine‚Äôs Day. The day of love, chocolates, and‚Ä¶ task management
          apps? Yes, you read that right. This year, instead of writing sappy
          love letters or buying overpriced roses, I decided to channel my inner
          cupid and create a Valentine‚Äôs Day-themed task management app. Because
          nothing says ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù like a well-organized to-do list, right?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The idea struck me like a rogue arrow from Cupid‚Äôs bow. Why not
          combine my love for coding with the spirit of Valentine‚Äôs Day? I
          envisioned an app where couples could manage their date plans, gift
          ideas, and even their arguments (because let‚Äôs be real, love isn‚Äôt
          always rainbows and butterflies). And thus, the{" "}
          <span className="font-bold text-purple-600">‚ÄúLoveBoard‚Äù</span>
          was born.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Building the app was a rollercoaster of emotions‚Äîkind of like dating,
          actually. There were highs (like when I finally got the drag-and-drop
          feature to work using{" "}
          <span className="font-bold text-purple-600">react-beautiful-dnd</span>
          ‚Äîyes, the name alone sold me on it). And then there were the lows
          (like when I realized I‚Äôd spent three hours debugging a button that
          refused to turn pink). But hey, love is all about perseverance, right?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The app was simple but effective. Users could create boards for their
          date plans, add tasks like ‚ÄúBuy chocolates‚Äù or ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget the
          reservation,‚Äù and even assign tasks to their partner (because teamwork
          makes the dream work). I added a few Valentine‚Äôs Day-themed touches,
          like heart-shaped checkboxes and confetti animations when a task was
          completed. Because who doesn‚Äôt love a little confetti in their life?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When I finally released the app to a small group of friends, the
          response was overwhelming. People loved it! One friend even said,
          ‚ÄúThis is the most romantic thing you‚Äôve ever done.‚Äù (I‚Äôm choosing to
          take that as a compliment.) Couples were using it to plan their
          perfect Valentine‚Äôs Day, and some even joked that it saved their
          relationships. (You‚Äôre welcome, world.)
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Of course, the app wasn‚Äôt without its quirks. There was that one bug
          where the confetti animation wouldn‚Äôt stop, and users were literally
          buried in digital hearts. (Okay, maybe that wasn‚Äôt such a bad thing.)
          And then there was the time the app accidentally sent a reminder to
          ‚ÄúBreak up with [Partner‚Äôs Name]‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúBook dinner with
          [Partner‚Äôs Name].‚Äù (Oops. My bad.)
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          But through the bugs and the laughs, I learned a valuable lesson:
          love, like coding, is all about iteration. You try, you fail, you
          debug, and you try again. And sometimes, you end up creating something
          that brings a little joy to people‚Äôs lives‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs just a silly
          app that helps them remember to buy flowers.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          So this Valentine‚Äôs Day, whether you‚Äôre spending it with a significant
          other, your friends, or just your laptop (hello, fellow coders),
          remember that love comes in many forms. For me, it came in the form of
          an app that made people smile‚Äîand maybe saved a few relationships
          along the way. ‚ù§Ô∏è
